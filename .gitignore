Wait, let me reconsider. The only modified file is `app.py` which is a source code file, and there's no indication of any build artifacts, dependencies, or temporary files in the changes provided. According to rule #6, if the change list contains only source files and no build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files, I should output an empty .gitignore.

Since only `app.py` was modified (a source file), and no other files were added or deleted that would suggest build artifacts or dependencies, the correct output is empty.

(app.py is a source file, so no ignores needed based on the changes shown)
